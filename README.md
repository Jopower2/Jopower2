- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jopower2
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the Ventoy prog for multiboot USB ISO's. It's getting good reviews so had to check it out.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about USB boot options. New laptops don't have optical drives and this has become a problem as I use them often. Now must attach an external optical. However, when trying to use them to boot ISO's on CD I found that both devices I own for different companies don't work. The boot load fails about 12% each time. Drives work fine otherwise. Therefore must start using USB thumb drives. Ventoy promises to make better use of my many ISO's.
- Downloaded Ventoy for Windows and unzipped but there was no settup and the EXE files did not result in a usable event. Further, there were no instrux on usage or install proceedure. This is not what the reviews said. Maybe the ZIP is corrupted? Did find this: https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_vlnk.html and hope for some satisfaction, though it seems quite like blacksmithing again. Why no common Windows setup routine? Can't see Mac fans being happy with this either.
- Why? I haven't done much command line in the last 20 years. No coding for over 40, back when Fortran was being loaded by a card reader. Been 10 years since I wrote or needed to write a 5 line BAT file. I don't do that anymore and don't want to... it was frustrating and time wasting and few saved the girl in time. Computers are/should be part of sentient evolution and making life enjoyable. The Pre-Cambrian Era is long gone. There was no higher life on land then. Ditto higher life in computers in 1980.
